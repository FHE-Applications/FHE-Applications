## Notebooks

You can find notebooks implementing a plain ResNet20 for different reasons:

* `ExportingWeights.ipynb`: this shows the procedure used to export the weights of ResNet20, including the masking phase of `K` values
* `FindingDeltas.ipynb`: with this notebook is possible to find the experimentally found values of $\delta$. Check Section 2.4.1 of the paper

Then, for each experiment:

* `Experiment Xth.ipynb`: with this notebook is possible to see some accuracy results on different experiments, evaluated at the end of each ResNet20 layer using the formula described in the paper.
